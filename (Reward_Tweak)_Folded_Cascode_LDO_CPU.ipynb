Instead, we calculate the resistance values using the sheet resistance and resistor geometric parameters. Class attributes such as `edge_type` and `edge_index` are used to construct the RGCN. `action_space_low` and `action_space_high` define the action space.

Ideally, it is beneficial to have the agent learn from more past experience in each step. However, a larger batch size may lead to a slower learning process. In this work, we chose a batch size of 128 and a total memory size of 1e5."
