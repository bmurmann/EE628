Instead, we calculate the resistance values using the sheet resistance and resistor geometric parameters. Class attributes such as `edge_type` and `edge_index` are used to construct the RGCN. `action_space_low` and `action_space_high` define the action space. Finally, the desirable circuit specifications are included at the end."

Ideally, it is beneficial to have the agent learn from more past experience in each step. However, a larger batch size may lead to a slower learning process. In this work, we chose a batch size of 128 and a total memory size of 1e5."
